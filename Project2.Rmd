# Define the Goals:

* Using attrition Data Set, identify the top three factors that contribute to turnover/attrition.  Also, explore job role specific trends that may exist in the data set (e.g., “Data Scientists have the highest job satisfaction”). 

* build a model to predict attrition
* build a model to predict salaries

```
## Initial Meta Data and Data Profiling Analysis
### Variables Analysis:
Examining the Attrition dataset, we note that it consists of 870 observations and 36 attributes/variables.  The original variables consisted of  27 integers and 9 factors. 


```{r, echo= FALSE}
skim(MainAttrDF)
#Visualize Metadata using visdat library
# vis_dat(MainAttrDF)
# Column types Using the inspectdf library
Types1 <- inspect_types(MainAttrDF)
show_plot (Types1)
```

### Missing Values:
Analysis reveals that there are no missing values to be dealt with.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Missing values Bar Plots
Nas1 <- inspect_na(MainAttrDF)
show_plot(Nas1, )
```

### Data Profiling Analysis and Categorical imbalance
As illustrated in the charts below, some of the categorical variables appear to be imbalance.  This may need to be dealt with prior to fitting the models.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Categorical Plot
Catg1 <- inspect_cat(MainAttrDF)
show_plot (Catg1)
# Feature Imbalance
Imb <-  inspect_imb(MainAttrDF)
show_plot (Imb)
```

## Variable pruning
variables that have SD=0, or have one value for example over18=Yes, or provide similar information will be removed from the data set as they are not providing any analytical value.
Additional pruning was done using correlation analysis.  Heat map was produced to remove attributes that are highly correlated.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Rmove Variables that do not provice any analytical value.
MainAttrDF$EmployeeCount <- NULL # SD = 0
MainAttrDF$StandardHours <- NULL # SD = 0
MainAttrDF$Over18 <- NULL        # SD = 0
MainAttrDF$DailyRate <- NULL     # Provides similar /Duplicative information as Monthly Income
MainAttrDF$HourlyRate <- NULL    # Provides similar /Duplicative information as Monthly Income  
MainAttrDF$MonthlyRate <- NULL   # Provides similar /Duplicative information as Monthly Income  
MainAttrDF$EmployeeNumber <-NULL # This is an identifiers, so it does not contribute to the analysis

#create a DF with numerical values only to study the SD for all atributes at once. and to use in heatmap to identify correlated values

```

## Correlated Attributes:
Identify correlated attributes using heat map and keep the one that has most influence on attrition

```{r, echo= FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Draw correlation heat map
NumMainAttrDF <-MainAttrDF %>% keep(is.numeric) %>% na.omit 
lapply(NumMainAttrDF,sd) #EmployeeCount, StandardHours have SD=0
```
```{r, echo= FALSE}
NumMainAttrDF %>% cor %>% corrplot("upper", addCoef.col = "black", number.digits = 2,
			 number.cex = 0.7, method="square",
			 order="hclust", title="Variable Corr Heat map",
			 tl.srt=45, tl.cex = 0.8)
# PercentSalaryHike – PerformanceRate have a correlation of 0.78. Keep PercentSalaryHike
# YearsWithCurrManager – YearsAtCompany have a correlation of 0.77. Keep YearsAtCompany 
# YearsWithCurrManager – YearsInCurrentRole have a correlation of 0.71. Both removed.
# YearsAtCompany - YearsInCurrentRole have a correlation of 0.78. Keep YearsAtCompany
# TotalWorkingYears – JobLevel have a correlation of 0.78. Both removed. 
# TotalWorkingYears – MonthlyIncome have a correlation of 0.78.  Keep MonthlyIncome
# JobLevel – MonthlyIncome have a correlation of 0.95. Remove Joblevel and Keep MonthlyIncome
# YearsAtCompany - YearSinceLastPromotion have a corroletion of 0.64 since those could related, I will remove yearssincelast promotion.
```

## Determine which of the numerical (discreet and continuous) attributes are important to attrition

### Age: 
Age does not seem to have much impact on attrition where the average age of the employees that are is slightly lower than the average age of employees that are staying.  


```{r, echo= FALSE}
# # Age seems to have an impact on attrition, however, I believ
 ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "Age", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
# ## How does Age and Length of Service affect termination?
 Ed1 <- MainAttrDF %>% select(Attrition,Age,YearsAtCompany,DistanceFromHome,Education )
 featurePlot(x=Ed1[,2:3],y=Ed1$Attrition,plot="density",auto.key = list(columns =1))
 featurePlot(x=Ed1[,2:3],y=Ed1$Attrition,plot="box",auto.key = list(columns = 2))
```

### Years At Company:
The age observation closely tracks with the years at the company.  This attribute also shows slight significance as it relates to attrition.  The density chart shows employees tend to mostly leave within years 1-3

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# YearsWithCurrManager and YearsAtCompany have a correlation of 0.77. Keep YearsAtCompany 1st cut.  Using logic, we can assume that as yearsAtCompany increases, so will the Salary.  Thus I chose to remove yearsAtCompany and Keep MonthlyIncome
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "YearsAtCompany", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
```

### Years with current manager: 
The number of years working with the same manager does not seem to have much impact on attrition.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "YearsWithCurrManager", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
MainAttrDF$YearsWithCurrManager <- NULL   # Heat Map shows  minimal Attrition, remove. -- 1st cut
MainAttrDF$YearsAtCompany <- NULL   # chose to remove yearsAtCompany and Keep MonthlyIncome --2nd cut
```

### Years in current role: 
The variable does not seem to have much impact on attrition

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# YearsWithCurrManager – YearsInCurrentRole have a correlation of 0.71. Keep YearsInCurrentRole 1st cut.  sing logic, we can assume that as YearsInCurrentRole increases, so will the Salary.  Thus I chose to remove yearsAtCompany and Keep MonthlyIncome
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "YearsInCurrentRole", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
MainAttrDF$YearsInCurrentRole <- NULL
```

### Total Working Years: 
This variable seems to have some impact on attrition as the density graph shows the density for the yes and no categories are slightly off indicating some influence.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
# related, Numerical plot
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "TotalWorkingYears", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
```

### Monthly Income: 
This variable seems to have some impact on attrition as the density graph shows the density for the yes and no categories are slightly off indicating some influence.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "MonthlyIncome", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
```

### Years Since Last Promotion: 
This variable does not seem to have some impact on attrition as the density graph shows the density for the yes and no categories are almost aligned indicating minimal Influence.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Numerical Plot
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "YearsSinceLastPromotion", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
MainAttrDF$YearsSinceLastPromotion <- NULL
# YearsWithCurrManager – YearsAtCompany h
# YearsAtCompany - YearsInCurrentRole have a correlation of 0.78. Keep YearsAtCompany
# TotalWorkingYears – JobLevel have a correlation of 0.78. TotalWorkingYears removed. 
# TotalWorkingYears – MonthlyIncome have a correlation of 0.78.  Keep MonthlyIncome
# JobLevel – MonthlyIncome have a correlation of 0.95. Remove Joblevel and Keep MonthlyIncome
# YearsAtCompany - YearSinceLastPromotion have a corroletion of 0.64 since those could related, I will remove yearssincelast promotion.
# Remove correlated attributes

MainAttrDF$TotalWorkingYears <- NULL
#MainAttrDF$JobLevel <- NULL  # Will be assessed as a categorical variable
```

### Distance from home: 
This attribute appears to have an influence on attrition the density graph shows that people that have shorter commute have a higher probability of staying (not quitting)

```{r, echo= FALSE}
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "DistanceFromHome", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
Ed1 <- MainAttrDF %>% select(Attrition,DistanceFromHome,Education )
#featurePlot(x=Ed1[,2],y=Ed1$Attrition,plot="density",auto.key = list(columns =1),labels = c("Distance From home", "Percent"))
# featurePlot(x=Ed1[,2],y=Ed1$Attrition,plot="box",auto.key = list(columns =1),labels = c("Attrition", "Distance From Home"))
```


### Number Of Companies Worked: 
Density chart for both attrition categories (Yes/No) is not much different based on the number of companies they've worked at. One exception is Employees who worked at one or two companies seem to have higher tendency to stay with the company.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# Numerical plot.
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "NumCompaniesWorked", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
```

### Percent Salary Hike: 
Density chart for both attrition categories (Yes/No) is not much different based on percentage salary hike they've received. 

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# PercentSalaryHike – PerformanceRate have a correlation of 0.78. Density Plot shows no to minimal impact on attrition. Remove both
# related, Numerical plot
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "PercentSalaryHike", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
```

### Performance Rating: 
Density chart for both attrition categories (Yes/No) is not much different based on the performance rating.  One exception is the employees the received a performance rating between 3.0 and 3.125 have tendency to stay with the company. 

```{r, echo= FALSE}
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "PerformanceRating", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
MainAttrDF$PerformanceRating <- NULL # Denstity graph shows minimal Attrition, remove.
#MainAttrDF$PercentSalaryHike <- NULL # Denstity graph shows minimal Attrition, remove.
NumMainAttrDF <-MainAttrDF %>% keep(is.numeric) %>% na.omit 
# Distribution of the numeric variables
Numv <- inspect_num(NumMainAttrDF)
show_plot(Numv)
# Correlations
# Corl <- inspect_cor(MainAttrDF)
# show_plot (Corl)
```
```{r, echo= FALSE}
# convert Numerical categories into factors
MainAttrDF$F_Education <- as.factor(MainAttrDF$Education )%>% ordered()
MainAttrDF$F_EnvironmentSatisfaction <- as.factor(MainAttrDF$EnvironmentSatisfaction ) %>% ordered()
MainAttrDF$F_JobInvolvement <- as.factor(MainAttrDF$JobInvolvement ) %>% ordered()

MainAttrDF$F_WorkLifeBalance <- as.factor(MainAttrDF$WorkLifeBalance ) %>% ordered()
```

### Education Level : 
Density chart for both attrition categories (Yes/No) is not much different based on the Education Level.  One exception is the employees the received a four years degree have tendency to stay with the company. 

```{r, echo= FALSE}
#cat 5 levels
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "Education", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5) 
```

### Relationship Satisfaction: 
Density chart for both attrition categories (Yes/No) indicate that employee with higher relationship satisfaction, 3 and 4, tend to stay with the company.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
#cat 4 levels
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "RelationshipSatisfaction", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
```

### Relationship Satisfaction: 
Density chart for both attrition categories (Yes/No) indicate that employee with stock option levels of 1 and 2 have a much higher retention rate and tend to stay with the company.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
#cat 3 levels
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "StockOptionLevel", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
```

### Work Life Balance: 
Density chart for both attrition categories (Yes/No) for Work Life Balance is quite similar with the exception for level 3 have a higher retention rate and tend to stay with the company.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
#cat 4 levels
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "WorkLifeBalance", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
```

### Job Level: 
Density chart for both attrition categories (Yes/No) for Job Level is quite different especially for levels 1, 2 and 4.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# cat 5 levels
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "JobLevel", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
```

### Environment Satisfaction: 
Density chart for both attrition categories (Yes/No) for Environment Satisfaction is quite different especially for levels 2, 3 and 4.  The more satisfaction the higher the retention.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
#cat 4 levels
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "EnvironmentSatisfaction", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
```

### Job Involvement: 
Density chart for both attrition categories (Yes/No) for Job Involvement is somewhat similar the exception is for Job Involvement level 4, those employees have a much higher retention.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
#cat 4 levels
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "JobInvolvement", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
```

### Job Satisfaction: 
Density chart for both attrition categories (Yes/No) for Job satisfaction is very  similar the exception is for Job satisfaction levels 3 and 4 those employees have a higher retention.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
#cat 4 levels
ggplot(data = MainAttrDF) + geom_density(aes_string(x = "JobSatisfaction", fill = "Attrition"), alpha = 0.5)
```

## Categorical Analysis
### Attrition by Dept: 
Attrition level for the various dept is consistent and thus does not appear to be relevant to attrition

```{r, echo= FALSE}
library(dplyr)
# Create summary DF for Dept and Attrition
d2 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>%

    labs(title = "Attrition % by Department",x = "Department", y = "percent", fill = "Attrition Status")
```

### Attrition By Education Field: 
Attrition across the various education level is consistent and thus does not appear to be relevant to attrition

```{r, echo= FALSE}
library(dplyr)
# Create summary DF for EducationField and Attrition
Ed1 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>% 
   dplyr::group_by(EducationField,Attrition) %>%

### Attrition By Gender:
Attrition for both is consistent and thus does not appear to be relevant to attrition

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# str(MainAttrDF)
library(dplyr)

    labs(title = "Attrition % by Gender",x = "Gender", y = "percent", fill = "Attrition Status")
```

### Attrition By Job Role: 
This variable appears to play a significant role in attrition whereby the Sales Representative have a high attrition rate of 45.3% nearly twice as high the next job role of Human resources which has a rate of 22.2%.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# str(MainAttrDF)
library(dplyr)

    labs(title = "Attrition % by JobRole",x = "JobRole", y = "percent", fill = "Attrition Status")
```

### Attrition By Marital Status:
This variable appears to play a significant role in attrition whereby the singles have a high attrition rate of 26.0% nearly twice as high the married which has a rate of 14.1%.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# str(MainAttrDF)
library(dplyr)
# Create summary DF for EducationField and Attrition
Ed1 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>%

    labs(title = "Attrition % by Marital Status",x = "Marital Status", y = "percent", fill = "Attrition Status")
``` 

### Attrition By Over Time Status: 
This variable appears to play a significant role in attrition whereby over time employees have a high attrition rate of 31.7% are three times as likely to be attrition as non-overtime employees at 9.7%.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# str(MainAttrDF)
library(dplyr)
# Create summary DF for EducationField and Attrition
Ed1 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>%

# print("The first 6 observations of the merged file:")
# Add Percent Calculation 
mergeEdDF$Perc <- mergeEdDF$AttrStatusCnt/mergeEdDF$GdCount
# head(mergeEdDF, n=6)

ggplot(mergeEdDF, aes(x = factor(OverTime), y = (Perc*100), fill = factor(AttritionStatus))) +
geom_col() +
    geom_text(aes(
            label = scales::percent( (Perc)  ), group = AttritionStatus), 
            position = position_stack( vjust = 0.5)) +
    labs(title = "Attrition % by Over time Status", subtitle = "Over time = non-exempt", x = "Over Time (Yes= non-exempt)", y = "percent", fill = "Attrition Status")

``` 

### Attrition By Stock Option Level:
This variable appears to play a significant role in attrition whereby employees receiving no stock options (level 0) and those who receive the highest option (level = 3) have a high attrition rate the is almost three times that of employees the receive stock options at level 1 and 2.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# Create summary DF for EducationField and Attrition

# print("The first 6 observations of the merged file:")
# Add Percent Calculation 
mergeEdDF$Perc <- mergeEdDF$AttrStatusCnt/mergeEdDF$GdCount
# head(mergeEdDF, n=6)

ggplot(mergeEdDF, aes(x = factor(StockOptionLevel), y = (Perc*100), fill = factor(AttritionStatus))) +
geom_col() +
    geom_text(aes(

    labs(title = "Attrition % by Stock Option Level",x = "StockOptionLevel", y = "percent", fill = "Attrition Status")
```

### Attrition By Work Life Balance:
The majority of work-life balance categories have similar attrition rates.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# Create summary DF for EducationField and Attrition
Ed1 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>% 
   dplyr::group_by(WorkLifeBalance,Attrition) %>% 
   dplyr::summarise(count=n()) 
# Create a summary DF for  Dept
Ed2 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>% 
   dplyr::group_by(WorkLifeBalance) %>% 
   dplyr::summarise(count=n()) 

#Create a Summary DF for Attrition By Dept
mergeEdDF <- merge(Ed1, Ed2, by.x = "WorkLifeBalance", by.y = "WorkLifeBalance")
colnames(mergeEdDF)[2] = "AttritionStatus"
colnames(mergeEdDF)[3] = "AttrStatusCnt"
colnames(mergeEdDF)[4] = "GdCount"
# print("The first 6 observations of the merged file:")
# Add Percent Calculation 
mergeEdDF$Perc <- mergeEdDF$AttrStatusCnt/mergeEdDF$GdCount
# head(mergeEdDF, n=6)

ggplot(mergeEdDF, aes(x = factor(WorkLifeBalance), y = (Perc*100), fill = factor(AttritionStatus))) +
geom_col() +
    geom_text(aes(
            label = scales::percent( (Perc)  ), group = AttritionStatus), 
            position = position_stack( vjust = 0.5)) +
    labs(title = "Attrition % by Work Life Balance",x = "WorkLifeBalance", y = "percent", fill = "Attrition Status")
```

### Attrition By Job Level:
This variable appears to play a significant role in attrition whereby the various job levels have drastically different attrition rates.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# Create summary DF for EducationField and Attrition
Ed1 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>% 
   dplyr::group_by(JobLevel,Attrition) %>% 
   dplyr::summarise(count=n()) 

# Create a summary DF for  Dept
Ed2 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>% 
   dplyr::group_by(JobLevel) %>% 
   dplyr::summarise(count=n()) 

#Create a Summary DF for Attrition By Dept
mergeEdDF <- merge(Ed1, Ed2, by.x = "JobLevel", by.y = "JobLevel")
colnames(mergeEdDF)[2] = "AttritionStatus"
colnames(mergeEdDF)[3] = "AttrStatusCnt"
colnames(mergeEdDF)[4] = "GdCount"
# Add Percent Calculation 
mergeEdDF$Perc <- mergeEdDF$AttrStatusCnt/mergeEdDF$GdCount
# head(mergeEdDF, n=6)

ggplot(mergeEdDF, aes(x = factor(JobLevel), y = (Perc*100), fill = factor(AttritionStatus))) +
geom_col() +
    geom_text(aes(
            label = scales::percent( (Perc)  ), group = AttritionStatus), 
            position = position_stack( vjust = 0.5)) +
    labs(title = "Attrition % by Job Level",x = "JobLevel", y = "percent", fill = "Attrition Status")
```

### Attrition By Environment Satisfaction:
The attrition rate is mostly consistent across the various levels

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# Create summary DF for EducationField and Attrition
Ed1 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>% 
   dplyr::group_by(EnvironmentSatisfaction,Attrition) %>% 
   dplyr::summarise(count=n()) 

# Create a summary DF for  Dept
Ed2 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>% 
   dplyr::group_by(EnvironmentSatisfaction) %>%

geom_col() +
    geom_text(aes(
            label = scales::percent( (Perc)  ), group = AttritionStatus), 
            position = position_stack( vjust = 0.5)) +
    labs(title = "Attrition % by Environment Satisfaction",x = "EnvironmentSatisfaction", y = "percent", fill = "Attrition Status")
```

### Attrition By Job Involvement:
This variable appears to play a significant role in attrition whereby employees receiving low job involvement (level 1) are 4 times as likely to be attrition (46.9%) as those in the next level of job involvement whose attrition rate is (19.3%)

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# Create summary DF for JobInvolvement and Attrition
Ed1 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>% 
   dplyr::group_by(JobInvolvement,Attrition) %>% 
   dplyr::summarise(count=n()) 

# Create a summary DF for  Dept
Ed2 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>% 
   dplyr::group_by(JobInvolvement) %>% 
   dplyr::summarise(count=n()) 

#Create a Summary DF for Attrition By Dept
mergeEdDF <- merge(Ed1, Ed2, by.x = "JobInvolvement", by.y = "JobInvolvement")
colnames(mergeEdDF)[2] = "AttritionStatus"
colnames(mergeEdDF)[3] = "AttrStatusCnt"
colnames(mergeEdDF)[4] = "GdCount"
# Add Percent Calculation 
mergeEdDF$Perc <- mergeEdDF$AttrStatusCnt/mergeEdDF$GdCount

ggplot(mergeEdDF, aes(x = factor(JobInvolvement), y = (Perc*100), fill = factor(AttritionStatus))) +
geom_col() +
    geom_text(aes(
            label = scales::percent( (Perc)  ), group = AttritionStatus), 
            position = position_stack( vjust = 0.5)) +
    labs(title = "Attrition % by Job Involvement",x = "JobInvolvement", y = "percent", fill = "Attrition Status")
```

### Attrition by Job Satisfaction:
This variable does not seem to have minimal influence on attrition.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# Create summary DF for JobSatisfaction and Attrition
Ed1 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>% 
   dplyr::group_by(JobSatisfaction,Attrition) %>% 
   dplyr::summarise(count=n()) 

# Create a summary DF for  Dept
Ed2 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>%

    geom_text(aes(
            label = scales::percent( (Perc)  ), group = AttritionStatus), 
            position = position_stack( vjust = 0.5)) +
    labs(title = "Attrition % by Job Satisfaction",x = "JobSatisfaction", y = "percent", fill = "Attrition Status")
```

### Attrition by Training Times Last Year:
This variable appears to play a significant role in attrition whereby employees receiving different levels of training have different attrition rates.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# Create summary DF for TrainingTimesLastYear and Attrition
Ed1 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>% 
   dplyr::group_by(TrainingTimesLastYear,Attrition) %>% 
   dplyr::summarise(count=n()) 
# Create a summary DF for  TrainingTimesLastYear
Ed2 <- as.data.frame(MainAttrDF) %>% 
   dplyr::group_by(TrainingTimesLastYear) %>% 
   dplyr::summarise(count=n()) 

#Create a Summary DF for Attrition By TrainingTimesLastYear
mergeEdDF <- merge(Ed1, Ed2, by.x = "TrainingTimesLastYear", by.y = "TrainingTimesLastYear")
colnames(mergeEdDF)[2] = "AttritionStatus"
colnames(mergeEdDF)[3] = "AttrStatusCnt"
colnames(mergeEdDF)[4] = "GdCount"
# Add Percent Calculation 
mergeEdDF$Perc <- mergeEdDF$AttrStatusCnt/mergeEdDF$GdCount

ggplot(mergeEdDF, aes(x = factor(TrainingTimesLastYear), y = (Perc*100), fill = factor(AttritionStatus))) +
geom_col() +
    geom_text(aes(
            label = scales::percent( (Perc)  ), group = AttritionStatus), 
            position = position_stack( vjust = 0.5)) +
    labs(title = "Attrition % by Training Times Last Year",x = "TrainingTimesLastYear", y = "percent", fill = "Attrition Status")
```

### Classify using the KNN:
I tried using Under sample, Over Sample and both none of the balanced training data produced the desired effect, to I decided to use the original data set. Using the analysis of the categorical and continuous variables conducted above, the following variables were selected to fit a KNN Model: StockOptionLevel, DistanceFromHome, MonthlyIncome, JobInvolvement.  Through multiple iteration of K,  Seed optimization, and different train/test split ratios the following parameters were the most optimal: 
K= 7, Split = 85%, and Seed = 100.  With these parameters, the model was fitted and trained and the below are the outcomes: prediction Accuracy = 86.1%,  Specificity = 75% Sensitivity = 86.5%

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# Approach: 
# 1- Use Training sets above (Under, Over and Both)
# 2- Find the best value of K Using the double Loop 

# Declare Variables
IT = 100 # Number of iterations to train
NK = 100 #Number of different K to try
Acc = matrix(nrow = NK) # Create Matrix to hold the accuracy data with size of I X NK
Spec = matrix(nrow = NK) # Create Matrix to hold the specificity data with size of I X NK
Sens = matrix(nrow =  NK) # Create Matrix to hold the sensitivity data with size of I X NK

i=0  # initializw

splitPct = 0.85
# Select column deemed most influencial based on EDA above.
AttPrd <- MainAttrDF %>% select(Attrition,StockOptionLevel,DistanceFromHome,MonthlyIncome,JobInvolvement)

# Build the Model and optimize the seed.
  for(i in 1:NK)
  {
    set.seed(i)
    trainIndices = sample(1:dim(AttPrd)[1],round(splitPct * dim(AttPrd)[1])) 
    train = AttPrd[trainIndices,]
    test = AttPrd[-trainIndices,]
    classifications = knn(train[,c(2,3,4,5)],test[,c(2,3,4,5)], train$Attrition, prob = TRUE, k = 7)
    #table(classifications,test$Attrition)
    CM = confusionMatrix(table(test$Attrition,classifications))
    # for each itirriation and K value capture the accuracy
    Acc[i] = CM$overall[1]
    # for each itirriation and K value capture the Sensitivity 
    Sens[i] = CM$byClass[1]
    # for each itirriation and K value capture the Specificity 
    Spec[i]= CM$byClass[2]
        }
# Find the mean for each ittiratio and K values.
CM 
MeanAcc = rowMeans(Acc)
MeanSpec = rowMeans(Spec)
MeanSens = rowMeans(Sens)
# which.max(MeanAcc)
# which.max(MeanAcc)
# which.max(MeanSpec)
#Plot the Accuracy vs the K values
plot(seq(1,NK,1),MeanAcc, type="h", main = "Seed values vs Accuracy (Optimal K=7)",xlab = "Seed Values", ylab = "Accuracy" )
plot(seq(1,NK,1),MeanSpec, type="h", main = "Seed values vs Specificity (Optimal K=7)",xlab = "Seed Values", ylab = "Specificity" )
plot(seq(1,NK,1),MeanSens, type="h", main = "Seed values vs Sensitivity (Optimal K=7)",xlab = "Seed Values", ylab = "Sensitivity" )
```
### Predict the Attrition from File
```{r, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
Pr_test <- NoAttrDF 
Pr_test$Attrition <- Pr_test$Attrition <- NA
Pr_test$Attrition <- as.factor(Pr_test$Attrition)

Pr_test$Attrition <- knn(train[,c(2,3,4,5)],Pr_test[,c("StockOptionLevel","DistanceFromHome","MonthlyIncome","JobLevel")],cl = train$Attrition, prob = TRUE, k = 7)
write.csv(Pr_test, "Case2PredictionsSalamah Attrition.csv")
```

## Naive-Bayes Model:
This model produced similar results as the KNN model but the accuracy was lower, 82% versus 86% and the specificity came out to be 0.  As a result, I decided to use the KNN model.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# Declare Variables

N_K = 100 #Number of different K to try
N_Acc = matrix(nrow = N_K) # Create Matrix to hold the accuracy data with size of  N_K X 1
N_Spec = matrix(nrow = N_K) # Create Matrix to hold the specificity data with size of N_K X 1
N_Sens = matrix(nrow = N_K) # Create Matrix to hold the sensitivity data with size of N_K X 1
i=0  # initializw

N_splitPct = 0.85
# Select column deemed most influencial based on EDA above.
N_AttPrd <- MainAttrDF %>% select(Attrition,StockOptionLevel,DistanceFromHome,MonthlyIncome,JobLevel)

# Build the Model and optimize the seed.
  for(i in 1:N_K)
  {
    set.seed(i)
    N_trainIndices = sample(1:dim(N_AttPrd)[1],round(splitPct * dim(N_AttPrd)[1])) 
    N_train = N_AttPrd[N_trainIndices,]
    N_test = N_AttPrd[-N_trainIndices,]
    N_model = naiveBayes(N_train[,c(2,3,4,5)],factor(N_train$Attrition, labels = c("No","Yes")))
    N_CM = confusionMatrix(table(
                                factor(N_test$Attrition, labels = c("No","Yes")
                                       ), 
                                predict( N_model, N_test[,c(2,3,4,5)])  
                                )
                           )
    # for each itirriation value capture the accuracy
     N_Acc[i] = N_CM$overall[1]
    # for each itirriation value capture the Sensitivity 
    N_Sens[i] = N_CM$byClass[1]
    # for each itirriation value capture the Specificity 
    N_Spec[i]= N_CM$byClass[2]
  }
# Display Confusion Matrix
N_CM 
```

## Linear Regression
### Validate assumptions:  
The GGPLOTS and point plots confirm the assumptions.  There is no evidence against normal distributions. There does not seem to be much evidence against a linear relationship between the means and there does not seem to be much evidence of non-constant standard deviation of the normal distributions.
